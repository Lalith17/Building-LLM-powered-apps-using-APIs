# TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Backend Architecture:

- Flask 2.3.3 with blueprint organization
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Google Gemini API for LLM integration
- Python-dotenv for configuration management

Frontend Technologies:

- HTML5 with semantic structure
- CSS3 with responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- No external JS frameworks (lightweight)

Security Measures:

- Input validation using regex patterns
- Template escaping for XSS prevention
- Environment variable protection
- API key security

Database Design:

- SQLite for development (PostgreSQL ready)
- User and Feedback models
- Foreign key relationships
- Automatic timestamp tracking

API Integration:

- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model
- Structured prompt engineering
- Response parsing and validation
- Comprehensive error handling

# TESTING RESULTS:

Test Categories Covered:
✅ Input validation tests (100% pass rate)
✅ LLM function integration tests
✅ Edge case handling
✅ Error scenario testing

Test Statistics:

- Total Tests: 22
- Passed: 22
- Failed: 0
- Success Rate: 100%

Known Issues:

- LLM API tests require valid GOOGLE_API_KEY
- Network dependency for full functionality
- Rate limiting may affect high-volume usage

# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

Quick Start:

1. Clone repository
2. Run: python setup.py
3. Edit .env file with API key
4. Run: python run.py
5. Open: http://localhost:5000

Requirements:

- Python 3.8+
- Google API Key (Gemini)
- Internet connection
- Modern web browser
