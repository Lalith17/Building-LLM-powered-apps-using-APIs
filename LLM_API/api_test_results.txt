Output: {'generated_text': {'parts': [{'text': 'Great question! The best follow-up will depend on the specifics of their initial answer, but here are several options that dig deeper into different aspects of leadership:\n\n**To Deepen Understanding of Impact/Outcome:**\n\n1.  "How did your leadership directly impact the final outcome or success of the project/situation?"\n2.  "Can you quantify the impact of your leadership, if possible, or describe the ultimate result that wouldn\'t have happened otherwise?"\n\n**To Explore Challenges/Obstacles:**\n\n3.  "What was the biggest challenge or obstacle you faced in that situation, and how did your leadership help overcome it?"\n4.  "Were there any moments of doubt or specific setbacks you encountered, and how did you manage them?"\n\n**To Reflect on Learning/Growth:**\n\n5.  "What was the most significant lesson you learned about leadership or yourself through that experience?"\n6.  "How did this experience change your approach to leading in subsequent situations?"\n\n**To Assess Self-Critique/Improvement:**\n\n7.  "Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently to enhance your leadership or the outcome?"\n8.  "What was the most difficult decision you had to make, and how did you arrive at it?"\n\n**To Focus on Specific Skills/Strategies:**\n\n9.  "Which specific leadership skill (e.g., communication, delegation, problem-solving, motivation) do you feel was most crucial for success in that particular scenario, and why?"\n10. "How did you ensure buy-in or motivate those you were leading, especially if there was initial resistance?"\n\n**Choose the one that seems most relevant to what they *didn\'t* fully cover in their initial explanation or what you\'d like to understand more about.**'}], 'role': 'model'}}

Test: Text Generation - teamwork
Timestamp: 2025-09-01 07:00:16 UTC
Input: Generate an interview question about teamwork.
Output: {'generated_text': {'parts': [{'text': 'Here\'s a strong interview question about teamwork, designed to elicit a behavioral response:\n\n**"Tell me about a time you were part of a team working towards a significant goal, and you encountered a challenge, obstacle, or had differing opinions on how to proceed. How did you and your team collaboratively overcome this to achieve your objective?"**\n\n**Why this is a good question:**\n\n*   **Behavioral (STAR Method):** It asks for a specific past experience, encouraging the candidate to use the Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR) method.\n*   **Focuses on Problem-Solving & Collaboration:** It directly probes how they navigate difficulties *as a team*, rather than just achieving a goal individually.\n*   **Identifies Conflict Resolution:** The "differing opinions" part allows them to demonstrate how they handle disagreements constructively.\n*   **Reveals Role & Contribution:** Their answer will naturally describe their specific actions and how they contributed to the team\'s success.\n*   **Shows Adaptability & Communication:** They\'ll likely describe how they communicated, listened, and adapted their approach.\n\n**What to listen for in their answer:**\n\n*   **Specifics:** Do they provide a concrete example or speak in generalities?\n*   **"We" vs. "I":** While you want to hear their personal contribution, a balance between "we" (team effort) and "I" (their specific actions) is key. Too much "I" might suggest they don\'t value team input, too much "we" might mean they\'re not clearly articulating their own role.\n*   **Problem-Solving Approach:** How did they identify the problem, brainstorm solutions, and make decisions as a group?\n*   **Communication Skills:** Did they actively listen, articulate their ideas, and facilitate discussion?\n*   **Conflict Resolution:** If there were differing opinions, how were they handled? Was compromise involved? Was the resolution respectful and productive?\n*   **Learning/Reflection:** Do they show any self-awareness about what they learned from the experience?\n*   **Positive Outcome:** While not every team project is a resounding success, they should ideally highlight how the challenge was overcome or what valuable lessons were learned.'}], 'role': 'model'}}

Input: Generate a follow-up question for: Explain a situation where you demonstrated leadership skills.
Output: {'generated_text': {'parts': [{'text': 'To generate a good follow-up question, you\'d ideally hear the initial answer first. However, assuming the person has just finished explaining their leadership situation, here are several types of follow-up questions, depending on what you want to probe further:\n\n**1. To delve into the *Impact/Outcome*:**\n\n*   "What was the *specific* outcome or impact of your leadership in that situation?"\n*   "How did your actions influence the team\'s morale or overall performance during and after that situation?"\n\n**2. To explore *Challenges/Obstacles*:**\n\n*   "What was the biggest challenge you faced while leading, and how did you overcome it?"\n*   "Did you encounter any resistance or disagreement from others, and how did you handle it?"\n\n**3.

Test: Text Generation - teamwork
Timestamp: 2025-09-01 07:02:43 UTC
Input: Generate an interview question about teamwork.
Output: {'generated_text': {'parts': [{'text': 'Here are a few options, depending on what specific aspect of teamwork you want to probe, along with why each is effective:\n\n**Option 1 (Comprehensive Behavioral Question - Recommended):**\n\n> **"Tell me about a time you were part of a team that successfully achieved a challenging goal. What was your specific role, how did you contribute to the team\'s success, and what challenges did you face as a team? How were those challenges overcome?"**\n\n*   **Why it\'s good:** This is a strong behavioral question that encourages the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). It allows the candidate to demonstrate:\n    *   Their understanding of team goals.\n    *   Their specific contributions (not just "we").\n    *   Their problem-solving skills within a team context.\n    *   Their ability to handle challenges and adversity collaboratively.\n    *   Their capacity for self-reflection and learning.\n\n**Option 2 (Focus on Conflict & Resolution):**\n\n> **"Can you describe a situation where there was a disagreement or conflict within a team you were part of? How did you approach the situation, what actions did you take, and what was the outcome?"**\n\n*   **Why it\'s good:** This directly assesses their conflict resolution skills, communication, empathy, and ability to prioritize team goals over personal differences. It reveals how they navigate difficult interpersonal dynamics.\n\n**Option 3 (Focus on Support & Accountability):**\n\n> **"Tell me about a time when a team member was struggling, or the team was falling behind schedule. What steps did you take to support your colleagues or help the team get back on track?"**\n\n*   **Why it\'s good:** This evaluates their proactiveness, willingness to help others, sense of collective responsibility, and leadership potential even if they aren\'t in a formal leadership role. It also probes how they handle performance issues within a team.\n\n---\n\n**Tips for Interviewers:**\n\n*   **Listen for specifics:** Avoid generic answers. Ask follow-up questions like "What exactly did *you* do?" or "How did that make your teammates feel?"\n*   **Look for the "we" vs. "I" balance:** Good team players acknowledge the team\'s effort, but can also articulate their individual contributions.\n*   **Probe for learning:** Ask "What did you learn from that experience?" or "How would you do things differently next time?"\n*   **Consider the STAR method:** Encourage candidates to structure their answers using Situation, Task, Action, and Result.'}], 'role': 'model'}}

What was your specific contribution, and how did you handle any challenges or disagreements that arose within the group?"\n\n---\n\n**Why this question is effective:**\n\n1.  **Behavioral Focus (STAR Method):** It prompts the candidate to share a real-world experience, allowing you to assess past behavior as an indicator of future performance.\n2.  **Multiple Facets:** It covers several critical aspects of teamwork:\n    *   **Collaboration:** Demonstrates their ability to work with others.\n    *   **Contribution:** Shows they understand their role and impact.\n    *   **Problem-Solving/Conflict Resolution:** Reveals how they navigate interpersonal dynamics and overcome obstacles.\n    *   **Goal Orientation:** Confirms their ability to work towards a shared objective.\n3.  **Open-Ended:** It requires more than a simple "yes" or "no" and encourages a narrative.\n\n**What to look for in a good answer:**\n\n*   **Clear Context:** Does the candidate set the stage (Situation and Task)?\n*   **Specific Actions (STAR - Action):** Do they clearly articulate *what they did* (their specific contribution) rather than just "we did"? This differentiates them from merely being present.\n*   **Team-Oriented Language:** Do they use "we" appropriately while also highlighting their individual impact?\n*   **Acknowledgement of Challenges:** Do they realistically acknowledge that teamwork isn\'t always smooth sailing?\n*   **Constructive Approach to Conflict:** When discussing disagreements, do they demonstrate:\n    *   Active listening?\n    *   Empathy for differing viewpoints?\n    *   A focus on finding solutions, not just "winning" an argument?\n    *   Professionalism and respect?\n*   **Positive Outcome (STAR - Result):** Do they clearly state the outcome of their efforts and the team\'s success?\n*   **Learning/Reflection:** Do they show any self-awareness or lessons learned from the experience?\n\n**Potential Follow-up Questions:**\n\n*   "How did you ensure everyone on the team was on the same page regarding the goal and individual responsibilities?"\n*   "What was the most challenging aspect of working with that particular team, and how did you personally adapt?"\n*   "If you could go back, what, if anything, would you have done differently in that situation?"\n*   "How did you support other team members who might have been struggling?"'}], 'role': 'model'}}
